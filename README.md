# Pastebin-Clone Project
Hello! This is a representation of the website "pastebin.com" in which the user is required to make an account in order to post something new or to search other posts. After the user has successfully logged in, then he can create a Post writing the name of the Author, the description of the post and the publish date. Each post has a "Create", "Edit", "Details" and "Delete" feature which will allow the user to perform the desired action.
